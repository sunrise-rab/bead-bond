## Rationale
Bead Bond was inspired by a young girl very close to me. Beading helped her become more confident, creative, and socially connected. She would spend hours making bracelets and sharing them with other girls. This project is built to bring that same healing, joy, and connection to other children and their families.
Bead Bond was created to support children's emotional, social, and creative development through beading. Many children especially those who have experienced trauma or isolation benefit from activities that involve creativity and bonding with others. Beading is not only fun, but it helps improve focus, fine motor skills, and self-expression. This project also encourages family involvement and community support through free workshops and donation-based funding.
